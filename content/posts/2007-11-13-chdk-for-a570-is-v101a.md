Today I managed to port [CHDK][1] to my Canon A570 IS fw v1.01a, based on rossig's sources for A570 IS v1.00e. The FW dump is done by [atppp][2]. Thank you A core.

I don't have other version of FW dump in hand, so it is a bit hard for me to find all entrypoints of the missing function. However, I have noticed most of the functions in 1.01a have the same address as in 1.00e, the rests have their addresses shifted by 0x74. So here is the result:

[a570-101a.FIR][3]  
[diskboot.BIN][4]

Read [here][5] for what CHDK is, and [here][6] for how to use CHDK.

Thanks fly to rossig (chdkuser AT fastmail DOT fm), [atppp][7]
