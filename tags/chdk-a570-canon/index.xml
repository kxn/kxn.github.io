The FW dump is done by atppp. Thank you A core.
I don&amp;rsquo;t have other version of FW dump in hand, so it is a bit hard for me to find all entrypoints of the missing function. However, I have noticed most of the functions in 1.01a have the same address as in 1.00e, the rests have their addresses shifted by 0x74. So here is the result:
a570-101a.FIR
diskboot.BIN
Read here for what CHDK is, and here for how to use CHDK.
Thanks fly to rossig (chdkuser AT fastmail DOT fm), atppp</description></item></channel></rss>
